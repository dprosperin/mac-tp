# **THIS IS AN OUTDATED VERSION!!** 
# **ST CLT (COMMAND LINE TOOLS) PROVIDE A FULL INSTALLATION! DOC [HERE](./tools_st_clt.md)** 

# Required tools: Cross-compiler, CMake, ST-Link

The target is a ST Nucleo32 board STM32F303K8.

Here, we use:
 * a cross-compiler for the cortex ARM target (`arm-none-eabi-gcc`)
 * a tool to upload and debug on the target: `st-link`
 * a tool to handle the project (compilation/flash recipes): `cmake`
 * an IDE (QtCreator, Eclipse, VSCode, …), or a lightweight editor (Vim, gedit, …)

The compiler suite is `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, the debugger `arm-none-eabi-gdb` (that can be used in command line interface, or through a gui like QtCreator or VSCode). The name stands for:
 * `arm`: the processor target
 * `none`: the operating system. Here `none` means that there is no operating system (baremetal)
 * `eabi` is Embedded Application Binary Interface and defines the rules to interact with other binaries (how to give the function arguments in the asm for instance)
 * `gcc` is the name for the `GNU Compiler collection`, a widely uses compiler.

 Here are some tips and links to install these tools on Linux, MacOS and Windows.


# Linux
On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu flavor), you should install:
 * `build-essential`
 * [st-link](https://github.com/texane/stlink)
 * [cmake build process software](https://cmake.org/download/)

## CMake
First the essential build tools and cmake
```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
```

## Cross-compiler

2 ways, packages or version packaged by ARM. First one is the simplest.

### from packages

You can get the cross-compiler from packages:

```sh
apt install binutils-arm-none-eabi gcc-arm-none-eabi  libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-dev libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-picolibc
```

The debugger can support different architectures (gdb-multiarch). To be able to use the Cmake rules, a symlink may be defined to `arm-none-eabi-gdb`. note the *backquotes* in the second command.
```sh
apt install gdb-multiarch
sudo ln -s `which gdb-multiarch` /usr/local/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb
```

On some Linux flavors, GDB may require library `ncurses`:

```sh
sudo apt install libncurses5
```
### from ARM

Alternatively, you can download [a version provided by ARM](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).
The archive may be decompressed, and the environment variable PATH should be updated (here if the archive has been decompressed to `/path/to/gcc-arm`):
```sh
export PATH=/path/to/gcc-arm/bin:$PATH
```

This environment variable should be defined each time a terminal is opened, so you can add it in the script executed each time a terminal is opened (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zprofile` or …).

Another way is to make a symbolic link from the executables to the `usr/local/bin`.

# STLink

The ST-Link tool (communication between the debugger gdb and the target) have 2 versions:
  * an open source version that [can be found here](https://github.com/texane/stlink)
  * the official ST version is [here](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html). It requires an ST account.

## Next…
As soon as all this stuff is correctly installed, you can configure an editor, such as [VSCode](./vscode.md) to develop your application.

# Mac OS X

On Mac, XCode should be installed, with the command line tools (App Store). You should agree the license in terminal (it has already been done on computers of the lab):
```sh
sudo xcodebuild -license
```

## CMake

Packages for cmake build process software [can be found here](https://cmake.org/download/).

A recent version of the [CMake build process software](https://cmake.org/download/) should be installed.

## Cross-compiler and STLink

You can [download the compiler here.](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).

The ST-Link tool (communication between the debugger gdb and the target) [can be found here](https://github.com/texane/stlink).

The archive of both the compiler and stlink may be decompressed, and the environment variable PATH should be updated (here if the archive has been decompressed to `/path/to/gcc-arm`):
```sh
export PATH=/path/to/gcc-arm/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/path/to/stlink/bin:$PATH
```

This environment variable should be defined each time a terminal is opened, so you can add it in the file `~/.profile`, which is a script that is executed each time a terminal is opened on Mac.

## Next…
As soon as all this stuff is correctly installed, you can configure an editor, such as [VSCode](./vscode.md) to develop your application.


# Windows

## Cross compiler

The cross-compiler is [gcc for ARM and can be downloaded here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)

You need to download the windows release `Windows (mingw-w64-x86_64) hosted cross toolchains` (64 bits host) or `Windows (mingw-w64-i686) hosted cross toolchains` (32 bits host). The target is `AArch32 bare-metal target (arm-none-eabi)`.

Once downloaded, you just have to run the installer. **Don't forget to click on the option `Add path to environment variable`!!!**

## ST-Link

### the tool

ST-Link [st-link](https://github.com/texane/stlink) => binary version [64 bits](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink/releases/download/v1.7.0/stlink-1.7.0-x86_64-w64-mingw32.zip) and [32 bits](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink/releases/download/v1.7.0/stlink-1.7.0-i686-w64-mingw32.zip).

information from [the README installation doc](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink):

`As of Release v1.6.1 stand-alone Windows binaries are made available (again) on the release page of the project. Please ensure to select the correct version for your system (i686 or x86_64). The archive file can be unzipped to any desired location as it does not contain any hardcoded paths. However we suggest to move the unzipped application folder to C:\Program Files\ on 32-bit systems and to C:\Program Files (x86)\ on 64-bit systems (the toolset is 32-bit). [...]`

You should:
 * decompress the `.zip` file
 * copy the directory (`stlink-1.7.0-x86_64-w64-mingw32`) to the `c:\Program File (x86)`

Then, we have to make the tools available in the PATH:
 * using the `search` button on windows:

![](img/environmentPath.png)

 * choose `environment variable` button (bottom of the dialog window):
  
![](img/environmentVar.png)

 * Then update the `PATH` variable and add the path to the folder `bin/` of the ST-Link folder that was previously extracted.
  
![](img/environmentVarPATH.png)

You can check that the gcc path has been correctly set! (first line in the previous image)

### the driver

You need to install the signed drivers. It can be found [on the ST website](https://www.st.com/content/my_st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-utilities/stsw-link009.html) (account required), or [on hippocampus](https://hippocampus.ec-nantes.fr/pluginfile.php/75584/mod_folder/content/0/en.stsw-link009_v2.0.2.zip?forcedownload=1).

* download the archive (`en.stsw-link009_v2.0.2.zip`)
* unzip it, and run the instaler (`dpinst_amd64.exe`).

### Please test ST-Link!

Then you may try your st-link installation:
* open a terminal (search for `cmd.exe`):
* connect the STM32F303 board
* run `st-util`. You should see sth like:

![](img/stlinkwin.png)

* close the program with `[Ctrl]+C`.

## CMake + Ninja

The CMake build process software [can be downloaded here](https://cmake.org/download/). You should choose the `.msi` file (windows installer).

During installation, please check the `add CMake to the system PATH`. In the other case, you will have to do it manually, as for ST-Link.

![](img/cmakeWininstall.png)

CMake will need a generator, as explained in [this page](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html). On Unix (Linux/Mac), the generator `GNU Make` as already available. On Windows, this generator is not so easy to install. We will use `ninja`.

`Ninja` can be found [here](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases):
 * download the binary `ninja-win.zip`
 * unzip the zip file
 * move the binary file to a location in the windows path. An easy way is to mode the binary to the `CMake/bin` folder (`C:\Program Files\CMake\bin`). It will work directly.

## Next…
As soon as all this stuff (cross-compiler, cmake, ninja, st-link and its driver…) is correctly installed, you can configure an editor, such as [VSCode](./vscode.md) to develop your application.
